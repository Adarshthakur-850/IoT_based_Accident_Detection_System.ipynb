🧠 Accident Detection and Alert System Using IoT Edge Computing
📘 Overview

This project implements a real-time accident detection and alert system using IoT Edge Computing and Machine Learning.
It analyzes IoT sensor data (speed, acceleration, gyroscope, vibration, etc.) to predict or detect accidents in real time, and automatically sends an email alert with event details to authorities or emergency contacts.

Built and trained in Google Colab, the model combines data analytics, LSTM-based deep learning, and IoT edge automation for intelligent public safety management.

🚀 Key Features

📡 Live IoT data monitoring and preprocessing

🤖 Accident prediction using trained ML/DL models (LSTM/CNN)

🎥 Real-time accident capture via connected sensors or camera

📬 Automated email reporting when an accident is detected

☁️ Google Colab compatible — no local setup required

⚙️ Extendable for deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano

🧩 Dataset

File Used: iot_edge_computing_public_management.csv
This dataset includes IoT sensor data points for public safety and vehicle event monitoring.
It’s used to train and validate the model to distinguish between normal and accident-prone behavior.

                  →  Feature Extraction
                  →  LSTM/CNN Model Prediction
                  →  Accident Detected?
                        ├── Yes → Capture Data/Frame
                        ├── Send Email Alert
                        └── Store Event Logs

🧩 Example Code
Load and Explore Data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('iot_edge_computing_public_management.csv')
df.head()

LSTM Model Example
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(timesteps, features), return_sequences=False),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=32)

Email Alert Code
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_alert_email(event_details):
    sender = 'your_email@gmail.com'
    receiver = 'recipient_email@gmail.com'
    msg = MIMEText(f"🚨 Accident Detected!\n\nDetails:\n{event_details}")
    msg['Subject'] = 'Accident Alert - IoT Edge System'
    msg['From'] = sender
    msg['To'] = receiver

    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as server:
        server.login(sender, 'your_app_password')
        server.sendmail(sender, receiver, msg.as_string())


⚠️ Use an App Password (not your real Gmail password) when using Gmail SMTP.
